#### About The Site

This website is for anyone who wishes to travel to the UEFA Euro 2020 football tournament taking place in the June & July 2020. Once a user clicks on a host city the Google Map zooms into that city. Some information about the stadium that will host games is also displayed along with the fixtures that are due to be played at that venue.

Then the user can select from 6 services - Food, Bars, Hotels, ATM's, Travel & Museums. Once a service is selected by the user, markers appear on the map relating to the selected service.

A countdown to the start date of the tournament is also shown on the site.

None

## Technologies Used


- [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/)
    -  **Bootstrap 4.1.3** was used to help with the grid layout, navbar and footer. I also used a Bootstrap JavaScript file for the navbar and modal.

- [jQuery](https://jquery.com)
    -  **jQuery** was used to complement Bootstrap to allow the navbar to collapse and also for the modal.

- [Flag Icon](http://flag-icon-css.lip.is/)
    -  **Flag Icon** was used to improve the display of each country on most pages.

## Testing

#### Validation

I ran each HTML file through a HTMl validator on [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org). This showed up some issues with stray i tags around some of the Social Media icons in the footer. The validator also showed up the fact that I had px after the height and width in the attribute of some of my images that I hadn't realised wasn't required.

I used [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) to validate my CSS file style.css, this proved to be all correct.
